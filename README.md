# 📥 Automated Invoice Processing System

An all-in-one Python application that:
- ✅ Connects to Gmail via IMAP and downloads **invoice PDFs**
- ✅ Extracts **Invoice Number, Date, Billed To, and Address** using `pdfplumber` + regex
- ✅ Saves all extracted data into:
  - **Excel** file (`invoices_log.xlsx`)
  - **SQLite** database (`invoices.db`)
- ✅ Runs continuously (checks Gmail every 5 mins)
- ✅ Optionally prints all invoices in CSV format
